Architecture of Synthesis: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations for Creating Multi-Agent Systems at the Intersection of Management, Dialectical Materialism, and Cognitive Psychology 

Introduction: The Crisis of Mechanistic Management and the Imperative of Interdisciplinary Synthesis 

Modern management theory and the practice of developing complex distributed systems are in a state of fundamental conceptual crisis. Traditional mechanistic models, which dominated management and computer sciences throughout the 20th century, viewed the organization as a deterministic machine and the agent (whether human or software algorithm) as a rational optimizer of a utility function. However, in conditions of exponential growth in the complexity of information flows, high uncertainty, and dynamic instability of the environment, these approaches demonstrate their limitations.

Linear logic, which excludes contradictions (the law of non-contradiction in formal logic), proves incapable of modeling real social and biological processes, where development occurs precisely through the emergence, aggravation, and resolution of internal conflicts. In response to these challenges, an urgent need arises to create a new class of intelligent systems—Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)—integrating the principles of dialectical materialism (Diamat), depth psychology, and the theory of reflexive control.

This report presents a comprehensive study of the methodology for building such systems. We view MAS not simply as a collection of interacting software entities, but as **Self-developing Reflexive-Active Environments (SRAE)**, where subjects possess the capacity for ethical choice, emotional resonance, and the dialectical sublation of contradictions.

The relevance of this synthesis is due to the fact that managing complex systems requires moving beyond the "subject-object" paradigm, where an active manager impacts a passive environment. Modern reality requires a transition to subject-subject and subject-metasubject relationships, which were developed in detail in the Soviet school of cybernetics and methodology. The integration of V.A. Lefebvre's "Algebra of Conscience," the BEN architecture (Belief-Desire-Intention + Emotions + Norms), and the principles of universal dialectical logic allows for the creation of a qualitatively new level of organizational intelligence capable of not only adaptation but also supra-situational activity.

Part I. Philosophical-Mathematical Foundation: Dialectical Materialism in Algorithms 

### 1.1. 

Ontology of Contradiction: From Formal Logic to Universal Dialectical Logic 

A fundamental obstacle to creating truly intelligent and autonomous agents has long been the rigidity of classical formal logic. In binary systems, the presence of a logical contradiction () is viewed as a fatal error leading to system collapse (the principle of *ex falso quodlibet*). However, from the perspective of dialectical materialism, a contradiction is not an error to be eliminated, but the "motor" of development, the source of self-movement of any complex system. The Hegelian triad (thesis — antithesis — synthesis) describes a process in which opposites do not annihilate but transition into a new quality, preserving their content in a sublated form (*Aufheben*).

#### 1.1.1. 

Distinguishing Logical and Dialectical Contradictions in Code 

When designing a "dialectical agent," it is critically important to algorithmically distinguish between two types of contradictions, as justified in the theory of Universal Logics:

* **Logical Contradiction (Deterministic Error):** This is a situation inadmissible in any functional system. For example, if a variable denoting an agent's physical location takes coordinate values  and  at the same moment in time . Such contradictions must be strictly excluded at the code verification level.


* **Dialectical Contradiction (Antithetic and Synthetic Unity):** This is the unity of mutually exclusive opposites inherent in the object of modeling itself. An example is the dualism of a coin (heads and tails exist simultaneously as properties of one object, though not visible simultaneously) or a conflict of goals in management (the need for process stabilization vs. the need for innovative changes). Universal logic views such contradictions as objects of positive inquiry.



#### 1.1.2. 

Mathematical Formalization: Universal Logics and Flexible Quantifiers 

To implement dialectics in software, the standard space of Boolean logic  is expanded to continuous or multidimensional spaces. Research suggests introducing flexible parameters () and specialized quantifiers that allow operating with uncertainty and the dynamics of becoming:

* **Threshold Element Quantifier:** This operator formalizes the law of the transition from quantity to quality. It tracks the accumulation of quantitative changes (e.g., accumulation of data, resources, or social tension) and initiates a qualitative leap—a change in the agent's behavior mode or system structure—when the parameter value exceeds a critical threshold.


* **Hypothetical Quantifier:** Allows the agent to work with degrees of trust and hypotheses. Unlike probabilistic logic, which operates on event frequencies, the hypothetical quantifier models the agent's subjective confidence in the truth of a judgment, which is critical for modeling human decision-making under incomplete information.


* **Transition Quantifiers:** Describe the dynamics of truth distribution changes over time. This allows modeling the process of "becoming" (*Werden*), where truth is not given statically but is revealed procedurally.



The use of **clusters of logical operators** (e.g., the Schweizer cluster) allows agents to dynamically switch between different logical modes—from rigid Boolean logic in critical safety situations to fuzzy or paraconsistent logic in negotiation and creative search processes, realizing the principle of flexible rationality.

### 1.2. 

Third-Order Cybernetics: The Return of the Subject 

The integration of dialectical materialism into artificial intelligence has deep historical roots in the Soviet school of cybernetics, which developed in parallel, and often in opposition, to the Western tradition. While Western cybernetics (Wiener, Ashby) focused on the concepts of "control" and "feedback" in technical and biological systems (first-order cybernetics), and later included the observer in the loop (von Foerster's second-order cybernetics), the Soviet school (A.I. Kitov, A.I. Berg, V.A. Lefebvre, G.P. Shchedrovitsky) initially emphasized the social nature of management, the activity of the subject, and the dialectics of development.

Modern developments, represented by the school of V.E. Lepsky, formulate the principles of **third-order cybernetics**, based on post-non-classical scientific rationality. In this paradigm, the very ontology of management changes:

* **From Object to Subject:** The object of management ceases to be viewed as a passive environment or a "black box". It is recognized as an active subject (or community of subjects) possessing its own goals, values, and, most importantly, free will.


* **Recursive Reflection:** Subjectivity is characterized by the capacity for reflection—awareness not only of the external environment but also of oneself, as well as awareness of how one is perceived by other agents. This creates complex recursive structures ("I think that you think that I think...") which become the main field of managerial interaction.


* **Metasubjectivity of the Environment:** The environment in which agents function ceases to be a neutral background. It is conceptualized as a **Self-developing Reflexive-Active Environment (SRAE)**, which itself acts as a metasubject, setting ontological frameworks, norms, and values. Management is carried out not through direct commands, but through changing the properties of the environment, which prompts agents to self-organize in the desired direction.



This approach requires abandoning hierarchical architectures in favor of heterarchical and network structures, where management is exercised through **soft influence** on the value and cognitive structures of agents, bringing us directly to the theory of reflexive control.

## Part II. 

Psychological Architecture of the Agent: Formalizing the Soul 

To realize the philosophical principles of dialectics and subjectivity, a specific software architecture capable of embodying them in code is necessary. The classic BDI model (Belief-Desire-Intention), which is the de facto standard in multi-agent systems, proves necessary but insufficient. It models "pure reason," ignoring the emotional-value component that plays a decisive role in real decision-making, especially in crisis situations.

### 2.1. 

BEN Architecture: Integration of Emotions, Norms, and Personality 

The most promising answer to the limitations of BDI is the **BEN (Behavior with Emotions and Norms)** architecture, implemented, for instance, on the GAMA modeling platform. BEN is a modular architecture that "wraps" the cognitive BDI core with layers of affective and normative regulators.

#### 2.1.1. 

Cognitive Core and Predicates 

At the heart of BEN lies the classic BDI cycle, where the agent perceives the world through a set of predicates. A predicate can represent a situation, event, or action. The agent operates with knowledge bases:

* **Beliefs:** What the agent considers true about the current state of the world.


* **Desires:** Target states the agent strives for.


* **Intentions:** A subset of desires selected for implementation at a given moment through specific action plans (Plan).



However, unlike pure BDI, the choice of intention in BEN is not a simple maximization of utility, but is mediated by emotions and norms.

#### 2.1.2. 

Emotion Module: Cognitive Appraisal Theory 

Emotions in BEN are not random noise or decorative elements. They implement a functional mechanism for rapid adaptation based on Cognitive Appraisal Theory. An emotion arises as a result of an instantaneous (often subconscious) evaluation of an event relative to the agent's goals:

* **Generation Mechanism:** The agent evaluates event  in the context of active desire .


* If  facilitates the realization of  Generates a positive emotion (e.g., Joy, Hope).


* If  threatens the realization of  Generates a negative emotion (Fear, Anger, Sadness).




* **Influence on Behavior:** Emotions serve as a bridge between perception and decision-making. They alter the **intensity** of mental states. For example, a high level of fear can instantly change priorities: the desire to "save face" (remain calm) is suppressed by the desire for "physical survival" (run), leading to a change in current intention (Intention switching). Without this mechanism, the agent would continue executing routine actions until the logical analyzer recalculated all options, which in a critical situation could be fatally slow.



#### 2.1.3. 

Emotional Contagion 

To model crowd effects and collective panic, BEN uses a contagion model, such as ASCRIBE or IMPACT. An agent's emotional state is not isolated; it is subject to the influence of the states of those around it. Formally, the intensity of emotion  for agent  at time  is calculated considering:

*  — **Charisma** of the source agent  (how strongly they broadcast the emotion).


*  — **Receptivity** of the receiving agent  (how easily they succumb to influence).


*  — decay or amplification coefficient.



This mechanism allows modeling the spread of panic, enthusiasm, or aggression in organizational structures, creating emergent phenomena not encoded in the individual code of agents.

### 2.2. 

Agent Personality: Parameterization of the OCEAN Model 

To ensure realistic heterogeneity (diversity) of the agent population, the BEN architecture integrates the "Big Five" psychological model (OCEAN). Psychological traits are not just tags, but mathematically define coefficients in behavioral equations.

**Table 1. Influence of OCEAN parameters on agent behavior in BEN architecture** 

| Personality Parameter (OCEAN) | Cognitive/Behavioral Parameter | Formalization (Example Dependency) | Description of Influence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Conscientiousness (C)** | Stability of plans and intentions |  | Agents with high C change plans less often when difficulties arise; they are more persistent and predictable. |
| **Extraversion (E)** | Charisma, social radius |  | Determines the strength of emotional influence on others and the breadth of the social circle. |
| **Neuroticism (N)** | Emotional susceptibility |  | Agents with high N (low stability) succumb more easily to panic and external emotional pressure. |
| **Agreeableness (A)** | Obedience to norms, altruism |  | Affects the probability of complying with social norms and readiness to help other agents. |
| **Openness (O)** | Tolerance to differences | Affects the weight of Solidarity | Agents with high O more easily establish connections with agents holding different beliefs. |

Such deep parameterization allows for stress-testing organizational structures. For example, how will a team consisting exclusively of "Neurotics" behave in a crisis situation? Or how will the presence of one highly charismatic "Extrovert" leader affect a group of passive agents? 

### 2.3. 

Social Relationships and Connection Dynamics 

Unlike simple graph models where a link either exists or does not, BEN models social relationships () as a **multidimensional vector**:

* **Liking (L):** Sympathy (from -1 to 1). Dynamically updated based on emotional interaction experience. If interaction with  caused joy in ,  grows.


* **Dominance (D):** Dominance (from -1 to 1). Reflects the hierarchy of power. If  experiences fear of ,  shifts towards subordination.


* **Solidarity (S):** Solidarity (from 0 to 1). A measure of similarity in beliefs and desires. High solidarity enhances empathy and mutual aid.


* **Familiarity (F):** Familiarity. Grows over the duration of interaction.


* **Trust (T):** Trust. An aggregated indicator of partner reliability.



This model allows simulating complex political intrigues within an organization: coalition formation based on solidarity, struggles for dominance, and the disintegration of ties due to loss of trust.

### 2.4. 

Case Study: Evacuation Simulation (Kiss Nightclub) 

The practical validity of the BEN architecture was demonstrated using the tragic example of the Kiss nightclub fire (Brazil).

* **Problem:** Classic physical evacuation models (particle flow calculations) could not explain the huge number of victims (242 people), as they did not account for irrational behavior: people returned to the fire for friends, crowded at false exits (toilets), ignoring signs.


* **Solution:** A MAS was created where agents possessed emotions (Fear), social ties (Friendship), and norms (Following signs).


* **Results:**
* **Herd Instinct:** Agents not seeing the fire were infected by fear from those running and joined the crowd, even if the crowd was running into a dead end.


* **Social Attachment:** Agents with high  and  indicators (friends, couples) spent precious time searching for each other, which reduced survival rates but corresponded to real data.


* **Normative Trap:** In conditions of poor visibility (smoke), agents followed the norm "go to the exit sign," which mistakenly led to the toilet, reproducing the real cause of mass death.





This case proves that without accounting for psychological variables, it is impossible to adequately model human behavior in extreme conditions.

## Part III. 

Reflexive Control and the Algebra of Conscience 

The pinnacle of synthesizing psychology and mathematics in the context of management is the theory of **Reflexive Control (RC)** and the **Algebra of Conscience**, developed by Vladimir Lefebvre. These concepts provide a formal language for describing how subjects make moral choices and how this choice can be influenced.

### 3.1. 

Algebra of Conscience: The Mathematics of Good and Evil 

Lefebvre proposed a revolutionary idea: moral choice is not just a philosophical abstraction, but a computable process amenable to strict mathematical modeling. He developed a Boolean model of reflexive choice that describes the agent's inner world.

#### 3.1.1. 

The Fundamental Equation of Choice 

A subject's readiness to perform an action () is described by the formula:




Where variables take values on a Boolean lattice of norms (e.g., 0 — evil/negative, 1 — good/positive):

* : **Pressure of the Environment** (Real Pressure). Objective stimulus or coercion to act.


* : **Image of Environmental Pressure** (Expectations). How the subject *perceives* the demands of the environment. This is a field for manipulation: an agent may see a threat where there is none, or vice versa.


* : **Intention** (Intentions). The subject's internal desire, their target setting ("what I actually want").


* : **Self-Image**. Reflexive comparison of the desired () and the expected (). If my desires correspond to what I think the world requires of me—my self-evaluation is high (cognitive comfort).



#### 3.1.2. 

Two Ethical Systems 

Lefebvre identified that the structure of the implication operator (the way of resolving conflict between variables) depends on the cultural code. He distinguished **two ethical systems**:

* First Ethical System (Western/Liberal):


* *Logic:* Compromise between good and evil is evaluated positively. Conflict is a problem to be solved.


* *Formally:* If an agent commits evil for the sake of good (compromise), they do not feel guilty.


* *Application in MAS:* Negotiator agents, mediators, sales agents.




* Second Ethical System (Soviet/Totalitarian/Heroic):


* *Logic:* Compromise with evil is evil. Conflict is a normal state of struggle. Good must be uncompromising.


* *Formally:* Any combination with a negative element colors the result negative.


* *Application in MAS:* Security system agents, military simulations, ideologically motivated actors.





In multi-agent systems, this allows modeling cross-cultural conflicts where agents "do not understand" each other not because of language differences, but because of differences in fundamental algorithms for evaluating "good/bad".

### 3.2. 

Strategies of Reflexive Control 

Reflexive control is the process of conveying to an opponent (or partner) such grounds for decision-making that they *voluntarily* make a decision predetermined by the controlling subject. The following RC strategies are implemented in MAS:

* **Manipulation of Self-Evaluation (Anti-Norm Axiom):** Based on the equation , one can force an agent to choose a disadvantageous action ("anti-norm") by artificially inflating their expectations (). If an agent is instilled with the idea that the environment requires the impossible of them (), their self-evaluation drops, and in a state of cognitive dissonance, they become manageable, often choosing irrational obedience or aggression. This explains mechanisms of propaganda and corporate manipulation.


* 
Reflexive Camouflage and Provocation:


* *Provocation:* The aggressor agent creates an illusion of weakness (lowers  in the eyes of the opponent), prompting them to attack under unfavorable conditions.


* *Overload:* Providing a large volume of contradictory information to paralyze the victim agent's analytical abilities (DDOS at the cognitive level).




* **Principle of Anticipation:** A successful agent must possess reflection of rank  relative to the opponent. If the opponent calculates my moves (rank 1), I must calculate how they calculate my moves (rank 2). In MAS, this is implemented through nested simulations ("Inner Worlds"), where the agent launches copies of other agents inside itself to test hypotheses.

## Part IV. 

Organizational Dynamics and the RASAHIA Architecture 

Integrating individual agents possessing complex psychology and reflection into a single organization requires specialized architectural solutions. Simple message exchange is insufficient ; structures supporting collective thinking and the resolution of dialectical contradictions are necessary.

### 4.1. 

RASAHIA Architecture: Reflexive-Active System 

One of the most developed architectures for such tasks is **RASAHIA (Reflexive-Active Systems of Artificial Heterogeneous Intelligent Agents)**, developed by S. Listopad. This system models the work of a team of experts (headquarters, board of directors, medical council) solving a task in real-time.

#### 4.1.1. 

Functional Structure of a RASAHIA Agent 

An agent in this system is not monolithic but consists of interacting layers:

* **Sensory-Motor Layer:** Interface with the physical or virtual world.


* **Cognitive Layer (Reasoning):** Traditional problem solver based on a knowledge base.


* **Reflexive Layer (Reflection):** The key component. It contains models ("phantoms") of other team agents.


* *Function:* "Reasoning for the other." Before expressing an idea, agent A runs a simulation of agent B's reaction. If a conflict is predicted, agent A can adjust the proposal *before* the act of communication (auto-reflection). This reduces information noise and conflict in the system.




* **Communicative Layer:** Responsible for exchanging ontologies and arguments.



#### 4.1.2. 

Dialectical Algorithm for Conflict Resolution 

Unlike market mechanisms (auctions) where the strongest (richest) wins, RASAHIA uses a dialectical approach to conflicts.

Algorithm of Dialectical Synthesis (Aufheben):

1. **Thesis ():** Agent 1 proposes a solution optimizing criterion  (e.g., speed).


2. **Antithesis ():** Agent 2 rejects the solution as it violates criterion  (e.g., safety). A contradiction arises.


3. **Explication of Grounds:** Agents exchange not just positions (yes/no), but logical justifications in the framework of dialectical logic DL. The root of the contradiction is identified.


4. **Synthesis ():** The system (or mediator agent) seeks a solution in a space of higher dimensionality. For example, changing the process technology, which removes the "speed vs safety" opposition. This corresponds to Hegelian sublation: old limitations are canceled, but the value of criteria  and  is preserved in the new solution.


5. **Verification:** The new solution  is checked for non-contradiction with the system's fundamental norms.



### 4.2. 

Organizational Artifacts and Context Management 

To manage the agent population without direct micromanagement, **Organizational Artifacts** are used. These are active environmental objects that structure interaction.

**Table 2. Typology of Organizational Artifacts in MAS** 

| Artifact Type | Function | Mechanism of Action | Example in Organization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Informative** | Creating a shared context | Provide a unified picture of the world ("Reflexive Mirror"), reducing uncertainty. | Dashboards, knowledge bases, maps of the current situation. |
| **Incentive** | Motivation and direction | Change the agents' utility function by introducing rewards or penalties for certain actions. | Bonus systems, KPIs, reputation ratings. |
| **Coercive** | Restriction and security | Physically or logically limit the space of available actions (Hard constraints). | Access systems, security protocols, blockers. |
| **Reputation** | Social control | Aggregate agents' behavioral history, forming trust () in the system. | Credit history, reviews, "social capital." |

### 4.3. 

The Problem of "Brain Rot" and Reflexive Exit 

Special attention in managing intelligent systems is paid to preventing looping and cognitive stagnation, referred to in modern critical theory as "Brain Rot" or semantic apocalypse. This is a state where AI (or bureaucracy) begins generating endless self-referential cycles of meaningless activity.

To combat this, the methodology of the **Moscow Methodological Circle (MMC)** is used. A special role is introduced into the architecture—the **Methodologist**. Their task is not to solve subject-matter problems but to perform reflection on the solution method itself.

* **Reflexive Exit:** The capacity of the methodologist agent to stop the process ("Freeze Frame"), enter a meta-position, and redefine the goals and means of activity. This allows the system to radically reconfigure itself in response to unprecedented challenges, avoiding the "hamster wheel" trap.



---

Part V. Subject-Oriented Approach: Toward Self-Developing Environments 

The final stage in the evolution of MAS is the transition from separate systems to **Self-developing Reflexive-Active Environments (SRAE)**, conceptualized by V.E. Lepsky.

### 5.1. 

From System to Environment 

In SRAE, the boundaries between "developer," "user," and "agent" are erased. The environment becomes a hybrid reality where humans, AI agents, and virtual subjects (representing collective entities, e.g., "Voice of the People" or "Interests of Future Generations") interact.

### 5.2. 

Principles of SRAE 

* **Principle of the Double Subject:** Each element of the environment is viewed both as a functional executor and as an ethical subject.


* **Subject-Oriented Platform:** Information systems are designed not to process data, but to support the activity of subjects. Interfaces become "reflexive boards," visualizing gaps in understanding between participants.


* **Social Responsibility:** Ethical principles are embedded in the system core ("genetic code" of the environment): a ban on selfishness (dominance of the private over the whole), the principle of non-violence, and the harmony of tradition and innovation.



---

Conclusion 

The creation of multi-agent systems at the intersection of management, Diamat, and psychology opens the way to next-generation management technologies. The integration of universal dialectical logic allows algorithms to work creatively with contradictions. Implementing the BEN architecture and OCEAN model gives agents human-like depth and unpredictability, necessary for realistic simulations. And the use of reflexive control theory and Lefebvre's algebra of conscience allows modeling ethical and strategic aspects of interaction.

The future of these technologies lies not merely in automating routine, but in creating "digital twins" of society capable of acting as simulators for finding ways for the harmonious development of humanity in conditions of increasing complexity. As the classics of dialectics taught, the task is not only to explain the world (model it), but to change it—through creating environments that facilitate the unlocking of the creative potential of every subject.
